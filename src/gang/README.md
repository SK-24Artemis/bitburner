# Gangs

Scripts to create and manage a gang. The script `/gang/slum-snakes.js` joins the
criminal organization Slum Snakes, setting the groundwork for you to create a
criminal gang within that faction. Once a member of a criminal faction, run the
script `/gang/crime.js` to create a gang within the faction. The process is
automated, the load chain being:

`/gang/slum-snakes.js` -> `/gang/crime.js`
