# Scripts

This directory contains all scripts for playing Bitburner. Your game play is
affected by whether you have access to the Singularity API.

> **NOTE**
>
> Get level 3 of `BitNode-4: The Singularity` as soon as possible. You can
> destroy BN1.1, then proceed to destroy BN4.1, BN4.2, and BN4.3.

1. If you have destroyed BN4.3, you have access to the Singularity API and the
   RAM cost of each function from the API is at its lowest. The game play is
   automated. All you need to do is run the script `go.js`.
1. If you are in BN4.1, you have access to the Singularity API. Furthermore, the
   RAM cost of each Singularity function is at its lowest. Take advantage of
   this to destroy BN4.1, BN4.2, and BN4.3. The game play can be automated in
   BN4.x by running the script `go.js`.
1. If you do not have access to the Singularity API, then most of your game play
   would be manual. [This guide](../doc/guide/README.md) helps you in your
   manual playthrough. Read the script `go.js` to help you figure out which
   scripts you need to manually launch to complete your playthrough.
