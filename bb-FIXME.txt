From Mughur#6872 on Bitburner server of Discord.

BB is quite simple tho.
sleeves:
-1 sleeve to do field analysis (this will keep the population estimate accurate, which means you'll know the actual success chance of stuff you do)
-1 to do diplomacy (this will keep chaos down. high chaos, >50, decreases success chances)
- 1 to take on contracts ( switching between them as their count goes to 0)
- rest to infiltrate synthoids (this will create more contracts/operations)

your tasks:
assassination, undercover operation, investigation, tracking. in that priority order, do the first one that has 100% success chance, if none of them do, get more combat stat exp by doing crimes or training general action
skills: get overclock to 90, buy stats so that assassination gets to 100% chance. when your rank gets high enough start buying skills so that blackops chance hits 100%.

last black ops beats WD

small tip for the sleeves that do infiltration
only let one of them do infiltration at a time and let the other idle to generate bonus time
than switch wich of those does infiltration to use up the bonus cycles
to get max generation out of each task

My notes
