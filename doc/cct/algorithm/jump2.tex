%%
%% Input.
\Require A directed graph $G$.  A starting node $s$, where we begin
our exploration.
%%
%% Output.
\Ensure An array $\ArrayB{d}{p}$.  Here, $d$ is a map of the shortest
number of nodes in a path to a target node.  Each path starts from the
given source node $s$.  For example, $d[i]$ gives the shortest number
of nodes in a path from $s$ to node $i$.  The map $p$ gives the node
preceding a given node, in a shortest path.  For example, $p[i]$ gives
a node that directly connects to node $i$, where $p[i]$ precedes $i$.
