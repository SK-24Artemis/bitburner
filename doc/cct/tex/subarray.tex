\section{Subarray with maximum sum}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Problem}

Consider an array of integers.  Determine the largest sum of a
non-empty, contiguous subarray.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Solution}

This is the maximum subarray problem, where empty subarrays are not
allowed.\footnote{
  Refer to Wikipedia for more details:
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem}
}
The problem is easily solved by Kadane's algorithm, as shown in
\Algorithm{alg:subarray:kadane}.
