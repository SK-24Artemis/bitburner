Scripts in this directory assume that you have access to the Singularity API.
To know whether or not you have access to the Singularity API, click on the tab
"Augmentations".  Under the "Source Files" section, locate a tab called
"Source-File 4: The Singularity".  If you cannot find that tab, it means you do
not have access to the Singularity API.  You must destroy BN4.1 to gain access
to the API.
