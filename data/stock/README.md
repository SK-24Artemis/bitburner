# Stock market

> Bitburner v2.2.2

Data on a trade bot that uses the 4S data and API. The
[driver script](../../src/test/stock/go4s.js) manages the
[trade bot](../../src/test/stock/trade4s.js). We use
[this save file](../../data/stock/stock.json). In each tick of the Stock Market,
the trade bot chooses the best stock to sell and the best stock to buy. Before
each run, the driver script ensures the seed money does not exceed $250m. Let
both scripts run for 24 hours, at the end of which print out the profit earned.

Here is an explanation of the headers in the data table. Numbers were rounded to
six decimal places.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- run := The run or experiment number. We performed a number of runs to gather
  data on the profits generated by the trade bot.
- seed := The seed money. This is the amount of money we started with prior to
  trading on the Stock Market. The seed money is usually about $250m.
- profit := The profit generated by the trade bot after running for 24 hours.
  At the end of 24 hours, the profit is determined by subtracting the seed
  money from the player's current money.
