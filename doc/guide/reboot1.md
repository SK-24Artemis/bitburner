# After the first reboot

You have installed your first batch of Augmentations, bought from CyberSec. Most
of your progress has been reset, but you get to keep the effects of all
Augmentations installed so far. All scripts you have saved on your home server
can still be found there. It is time to start again, but this time with slightly
better stat multipliers.

First things first. Let's restart your streams of passive income as per the
section [Starting out](start.md). Use the starting amount of $1k to purchase a
Hacknet node and let it generate passive income. While the Hacknet node is
running in the background, you need to upgrade your Hack stat. The simplest way
to do so is to take the course `Study Computer Science (free)` at Rothman
University, stopping when you have at least 10 Hack. You also need to work at a
company to supplement your passive income. Again, apply at and work for
FoodNStuff (or Joe's Guns if you want).

Second, follow the section [First script](script.md). Deploy your hack script to
the following servers: `n00dles`, `foodnstuff`, `sigma-cosmetics`, `joesguns`,
and any other servers to which you can gain root access. You might need to
commit crimes in The Slums to raise enough money to purchase the TOR router and
purchase various port opener programs via the dark web. All of these compromised
servers can be directed to hack `n00dles`. If you so choose, redirect the
compromised servers to hack another common target such as `foodnstuff` or
`joesguns`. Your objective is to use a bunch of world servers to target a
low-level server as a means of increasing your Hack stat and generate passive
income. As your stat multipliers are still rather low, you might find it more
profitable to target `n00dles`, rather than `foodnstuff` or `joesguns`.

Third, let's join another faction. You have already purchased and installed all
Augmentations from CyberSec. There is no need to join CyberSec again. You could
join CyberSec again if you want to level up the `NeuroFlux Governor`
Augmentation or perform hacking contracts to raise your Hack stat. However,
other factions also allow you to level up `NeuroFlux Governor`. This time
around, explore what the faction Sector-12 has on offer. The requirements to
receive an invitation from Sector-12 are:

1. Be in the city Sector-12. Do not travel to a different city.
1. Have at least $15m. You might want to commit crimes in The Slums to quickly
   raise this amount of money.

You can be a member of both CyberSec and Sector-12. While you work on hacking
contracts for Sector-12 you increase your reputation within the faction.
Simultaneously, you passively earn reputation within CyberSec, albeit rather
slowly. Let the game run until you have enough reputation points to unlock the
following Augmentations from Sector-12:

1. `Augmented Targeting I`
1. `Augmented Targeting II`
1. `Wired Reflexes`
1. `Speech Processor Implant`
1. `Neuralstimulator`
1. `CashRoot Starter Kit`

The `CashRoot Starter Kit` is useful because after a soft reset the Augmentation
would grant you $1m and the program `BruteSSH.exe`. It is worth waiting to
unlock and buy `CashRoot Starter Kit` from Sector-12.
