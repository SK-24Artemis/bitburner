# Hack requirement

The minimum Hack stat requirement for creating each program. In different
BitNodes, the Hack stat requirement for creating a program can change. For
example, in BN1.x you need at least 100 Hack to be able to create
`FTPCrack.exe`, while in other BNs the Hack requirement can be lower or higher.
We exclude `NUKE.exe` because that program is always available at the start of
any BN. `b1t_flum3.exe` is also excluded because it is not available in BN1.1
and you must destroy at least BN1.1 for it to spawn. Finally, we exclude
`fl1ght.exe` because its sole purpose is to give us a report on our progress in
a BN.
