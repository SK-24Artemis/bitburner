A bunch of save files. Each save file starts you at a particular BitNode. The
name of each save file follows the format `BNnxk.json`, where `n` is the BitNode
number and `k` is the level of that BitNode. For example, `BN1x2.json` starts
you at level 2 of BitNode-1. These save files can be used for debugging or to
help you test various aspects of the game.
