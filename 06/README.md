# Purpose of this directory
1. Retain the functionalities of previous directories.
1. Implement solutions to various coding contracts.
1. Assume we have destroyed BN1.1 so we now start with a default of 32GB RAM on
   our home server.  Various scripts loaded by `go-low.js` would not run if
   done under the default of 8GB RAM in BN1.1.  The scripts can also be run
   even if we have not destroyed BN1.1.  Simply raise enough money to upgrade
   our home RAM to at least 32GB.
