# Purpose of this directory
1. Retain functionalities of previous directories.
1. Use the Singularity API to automate most aspects of the game.  To know
   whether or not you have access to the Singularity API, click on the tab
   `Augmentations`.  Under the `Source Files` section, locate a tab called
   `Source-File 4: The Singularity`.  If you cannot find that tab, it means you
   do not have access to the Singularity API.  You must destroy BN4.1 to gain
   access to the API.  Destroy BN4.2 and BN4.3 to reduce the RAM cost of each
   Singularity function to its minimum.
1. Everything starts from the script `go.js`.  The game play is automated.
   All you need to do is run the script `go.js`.
