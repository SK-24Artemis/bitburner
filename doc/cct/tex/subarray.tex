\section{Subarray with maximum sum}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Problem}

Consider an array of integers.  Determine the largest sum of a
non-empty, contiguous subarray.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Solution}

This is the maximum subarray problem, where empty subarrays are not
allowed.\footnote{
  Refer to Wikipedia for more details:
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem}
}
The problem is easily solved by Kadane's algorithm, as shown in
\Algorithm{alg:subarray:kadane}.  Given an array
$A = \Array{a}{n}$ of $n \geq 1$ elements, Kadane's algorithm uses $2$
variables $g$ and $c$.  The variable $g$ keeps track of the greatest
sum of any contiguous subarray so far, whereas $c$ keeps track of the
sum of all $a_i$ up to and including index $i$.  Initially, $g$
represents a number lower than any $a_i$ and we set $c \gets 0$.  Step
through each array element $a_i$ in order of index and update
$c \gets \Max{a_i}{c + a_i}$ and $g \gets \Max{g}{c}$.
